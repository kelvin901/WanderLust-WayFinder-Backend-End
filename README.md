## Introduction

The Wanderlust Wayfinder Backend handles the core functionality of the application, including user authentication, destination management, and data retrieval. It serves as the bridge between the frontend and the database, providing a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Ruby on Rails
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (you can choose any other database supported by Rails)
- **Authentication:** Devise (you can choose other authentication solutions as well)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Wanderlust Wayfinder Backend, follow these steps:

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/wanderlust-wayfinder-backend.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd wanderlust-wayfinder-backend`

### Database Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL if not already installed.
2. Configure the database connection in `config/database.yml`.
3. Create the database: `rails db:create`
4. Run the migrations: `rails db:migrate`
5. (Optional) Seed the database with sample data: `rails db:seed`

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /destinations`: Retrieve a list of all destinations
- `GET /destinations/:id`: Retrieve information about a specific destination
- `POST /destinations`: Create a new destination (authentication required)
- `PUT /destinations/:id`: Update information for a destination (authentication required)
- `DELETE /destinations/:id`: Delete a destination (authentication required)

**Note:** Add more endpoints as needed for your application's requirements.

## Authentication

User authentication is implemented using the Devise gem. Users can register, log in, and log out using the provided endpoints. Protected endpoints (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting a destination) require a valid authentication token.
